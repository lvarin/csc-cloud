# What is Helm?
Helm is like a package (called **charts**) manager for Kubernetes and helps you manage Kunernetes applications.  
Helm charts help you define, install and upgrade Kubernetes application.

# Helm architecture
.container[
.col[
Three important concepts:
- **chart**: A bundle of information necessary to create an instance of a Kubernetes application.
- **config**: It contains configuration information that can be merged into a packaged chart.
- **release**: A running instance of a chart combined with a specific config.  

**Helm** is implemented into two distincts parts:
- Helm Client
- Helm Library

# Helm packages manager
As easy as package manager from Linux systems:
- `helm repo add`: Add a repository
- `helm repo list`: List your installed repository
- `helm repo update`: Update the index and allows you to benefit from the latest versions of packages.

---

# Helm packages installation
One command: `helm install`
It may require the installation of a repository before:
- `helm repo add ....`
- `helm repo update`
- `helm search repo ....`
- `helm install [NAME] [CHART]`  
After your installation, you can list your releases with the command `helm ls` (Use `-A` for all namespaces)

# What's next?
Helm allows you to build your own charts, more explication in the exercice [Packaging Containerized Applications](../exercises-containers/12-AppPackaging.html)
